Challenge Requirements

1 - Create an algorithm that runs through a one-dimensional array containing letters and numbers: [ “a”, 10, “b”, “hola”, 122, 15]
a- Get an array containing just the letters
b-Get an array containing just the numbers
c-Get the highest number from the array above

2 - Create a hashmap (or a simple object in PHP) that contains the elementary functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
a-Take into account that the division must not allow 0 dividend.<br>
b-The sum function allows an array as an input parameter and adds all its elements.<br>
c-The subtraction function allows an array as an input parameter and subtracts all its elements.<br>
d-Multiplication Function - Ditto.<br>
e-The division function accepts two parameters: a and b.<br>

3 - Create an algorithm that generates the following random ID pattern: XXXX-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC<br>
a-Where XXXX, AAAA, BBBB and CCCC patterns are random alphanumeric.<br>
b-The default is a string: "XXXX-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC"<br>
c-The result must be stored in a variable. For example:<br>
$id = generarId()<br>
id is ~ abc1-bb12-234a-bcc2<br>
